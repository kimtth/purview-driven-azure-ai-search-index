This paper \nreports on our progress in each of \nthe five plays and provides updates \nbased on lessons learned. \n\nIn this section \n\nForeword Actions & Innovations AI Investments Data & Infrastructure Energy & Resources Policy & Governance Workforce capacity Looking ahead \n\nWhy AI is essential for sustainability: \nThree capabilities \nAchieving global sustainability goals requires transformative \nprogress at an unprecedented pace and scale. To meet these \nambitions, scientists project that the world must triple carbon-free \nenergy capacity2, double energy efficiency by 20302, and reverse \nbiodiversity loss to achieve a nature-positive future. However, \nprogress is constrained by three key hurdles. First, many of \nthe challenges of sustainability\u2014such as managing energy \ngrids, improving resource use, and protecting ecosystems\u2014\nhave grown too complex for traditional tools and approaches. \nSecond, innovation often moves too slowly, as conventional \nresearch and development processes are time-consuming \nand costly. Third, there is a significant workforce gap, with too \nfew people equipped with the tools and knowledge needed \nto advance sustainability solutions. \n\nAccelerating Sustainability with AI:

\n\nEmpower the sustainability workforce \nAI enhances productivity by automating repetitive tasks, \nproviding actionable insights, and making advanced tools \naccessible to more people. \n\nThese capabilities make AI a critical enabler of sustainability \nprogress. By addressing complexity, speeding up innovation, \nand empowering people, AI helps deliver the scale and speed \nneeded to achieve a sustainable future. \n\nHow to unlock AI\u2019s full potential: Five Plays \nWhile AI is already being applied in transformative ways to \nmeasure and optimize complex systems, accelerate sustainability \nsolutions, and empower the workforce, these game-changing \ncapabilities can only be fully realized if key enabling conditions \nare in place. As outlined in our AI and sustainability playbook, \nachieving these conditions requires action across five strategies or \n\u201cplays\u201d. Each play identifies the steps needed to lay the foundation \nfor AI to deliver transformative impact on sustainability. \n\nPlay 1 \nThe world must invest in AI to accelerate  \nsustainability solutions \nWithout focused investments, AI\u2019s abilities to accelerate \nsustainability will remain underdeveloped and underutilized. \nAI cannot be a game-changer unless resources are directed \nto develop and deploy solutions that tackle challenges like \ndecarbonization, water management, and biodiversity restoration. \n\nPlay 2 \nIt is vital to develop digital and data infrastructure  \nfor the inclusive use of AI for sustainability \nAI models rely on high-quality representative data and the \ninfrastructure to process it.

If action is taken across \nthese five plays, the world can create the necessary conditions for \nAI to fully unlock its game-changing capabilities\u2014equitably and \nresponsibly\u2014and further amplify its impact in building a more \nsustainable future. \n\nAccelerating Sustainability with AI: Innovations for a Better Future 7 \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\nForeword Actions & Innovations AI Investments Data & Infrastructure Energy & Resources Policy & Governance Workforce capacity Looking ahead \n\nAccelerating Sustainability with AI \n\nPlay 1: Invest in AI  \nfor sustainability \n\nIn this section, we highlight examples \nof investments being made to develop \ntools and apply AI for each of its \nthree game-changing capabilities: \nmeasuring and optimizing complex \nsystems, accelerating sustainability \nsolutions, and empowering the \nworkforce. These AI capabilities are \nalready being applied across a range \nof sectors from energy to biodiversity \nand climate risk.  \n\nFollowing, we share some examples \nof how Microsoft is collaborating with \nvarious partners to apply AI\u2019s three \ngame-changing capabilities in two \nareas: the net-zero energy transition \nand climate risk management. \n\n1 Investing in AI to measure, predict, \nand optimize complex systems \n\nAI\u2019s ability to analyze vast amounts of data, identify patterns, \nand make real-time predictions enables it to optimize complex \nsystems that are central to sustainability, such as electricity grids \nand supply chains, while helping to transform understanding \nand management of biodiversity challenges and climate risks. \nThe following examples showcase

Project Guacamaya is an innovative \npartnership between Microsoft\u2019s AI for Good Lab, Planet Labs \nPBC, Instituto Sinchi, Universidad de los Andes, and the Alexander \nvon Humboldt Institute in Colombia that uses a combination of \ncamera trap footage and bioacoustics to identify species and \ntrack their recovery or loss in the Amazon rainforest.32 Project \nGuacamaya\u2019s open-source algorithms help scientists to identify \nspecies in over 110,000 camera trap images with 90% accuracy, \ndetecting not only native but non-native species indicative of \necosystem health.32 These tools cut analyses from months to \nminutes.30 In combination with high-resolution satellite data, \nthey allow conservation practitioners to monitor and manage \nthe critically important Amazon rainforest, which contains \na large percentage of remaining biodiversity and plays an \nimportant role in regulating regional and global climate.33 \n\nAccelerating Sustainability with AI: Innovations for a Better Future 10 \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\u2014\n\nForeword Actions & Innovations AI Investments Data & Infrastructure Energy & Resources Policy & Governance Workforce capacity Looking ahead \n\n2 Investing in AI to accelerate \nthe development of sustainability \nsolutions \n\nMany sustainability solutions are slowed by time-intensive and \ncostly research and development processes.

We recently signed a PPA \nwith Constellation, which will enable the restart of an 835-MW \nnuclear facility in Pennsylvania that was retired in 2019.105 \n\nWe are also investing in advancing geothermal as an \nincreasingly scalable firm renewable option.106 For example, \nMicrosoft\u2019s new datacenter in New Zealand will be supported by \n100% carbon-free electricity as a result of the 10-year agreement \nthat Microsoft signed with Contact Energy for the renewable \nattributes produced by Te Huka 3 geothermal power station.107 \n\nThe long-term contract with Microsoft supported Contact\u2019s \ninvestment decision to construct the Te Huka 3 power station \nand can generate 51.4 MW of reliable and renewable generation \nthroughout the year.107 Earlier in 2024, we signed an agreement \nwith G42, in collaboration with local partners, to design and \nbuild a state-of-the-art datacenter campus in Olkaria, Kenya, \nrun entirely on renewable geothermal energy and designed with \nstate-of-the-art water conservation technology.7 Our Climate \nInnovation Fund is also investing in companies like Eavor, which \nis developing next-generation geothermal energy technology \nthat can be deployed in a much wider variety of settings \ncompared to traditional geothermal approaches.108 \n\n$2.5M \nMicrosoft has invested over $2.5 million in community \nprograms across more than 70 partners in Iowa. \nThe funding has supported financial and computer \nclasses for immigrants and refugees, skilling and \ncareer development for underserved populations, \nand the Microsoft

building new markets to deliver the solutions we need. \nThrough the CIF\u2019s $1 billion investment mandate,142 Microsoft \nhas so far invested over $760 million to bring new supply to \nmarket and to accelerate adoption and cost reduction in key \ntarget technologies.\n\nBy serving as both an early buyer and an investor in the \ntechnologies to provide carbon-free energy, advanced \nmaterials, circularity, and more, Microsoft acts to kickstart \na market process that drives down cost and drives up supply. \nOur capital and purchase commitments attract additional \npartners in a multiplier effect to grow these markets. \n\nThrough the CIF, Microsoft is providing the demand signal \nand capital, along with engagement and technical solutions \nneeded to proactively scale markets for a sustainable AI \nindustrial revolution.\n\n27 \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nForeword Actions & Innovations AI

For example, by utilizing \nreinforcement learning and Microsoft Azure high-performance \ncomputing (HPC), Energy companies are optimizing wind farm \nperformance, predicting maintenance needs, and enhancing \nenergy production efficiency and reliability.13 \n\nIn addition to renewable integration, Microsoft is collaborating \nwith organizations around the world to develop and deploy \nAI-enabled tools to reduce methane emissions,14 a powerful \ngreenhouse gas, from a variety of sources, including the \nenergy, agriculture, and waste sectors.15,16 For example, in 2023, \nthe Global FoodBanking Network (GFN) started developing \nthe Food Recovery to Avoid Methane Emissions (FRAME) \nmethodology to measure and track the methane emissions \nprevented by food recovery efforts in food banks within its \nnetwork, covering 63 organizations in 53 countries.17 GFN used \nMicrosoft Sustainability Manager as a key tool for building a \ncustom emissions dashboard. \n\nThis dashboard was piloted with food banks in Mexico and \nEcuador to provide a clear, real-time view of their environmental \nimpact and alignment with the United Nations (UN) Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals.17 The built-in guidelines, carbon activities \nsettings, and standardized factors within Microsoft Sustainability \nManager streamlined processes, enhanced precision and ease \nin use. GFN plans to expand the methane mitigation project \nin other parts of the world, such as sub-Saharan Africa and \nSoutheast Asia, to help food banks that recover and redistribute \nsurplus food

Microsoft and \nthe Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) used AI to discover a new \nbattery material requiring less lithium \u2014a breakthrough achieved in weeks \nrather than the years that traditional research and development would have \nrequired.37 Reducing lithium dependence is crucial to decarbonization as \nglobal demand for lithium is projected to outpace supply.1  \n\nAccelerating Sustainability with AI: Innovations for a Better Future 11\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n  \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\nForeword Actions & Innovations AI Investments Data & Infrastructure Energy & Resources Policy & Governance Workforce capacity Looking ahead \n\nIn another project, Microsoft Research and Microsoft\u2019s Cloud \nOperation and Innovation team have partnered with the \nUniversity of Michigan to advance long-duration energy storage \n(LDES) technologies, a fundamental need for grid reliability as \nmore intermittent renewable energy, such as wind and solar, are \nintegrated into the electricity mix. Traditional flow batteries often \nrely on vanadium, an element that is costly and impractical for \nlarge-scale deployment.40 To overcome this limitation, Microsoft \nresearchers are using computational tools and generative \nmachine learning models to design organic redox-active \nmolecules as alternatives to high-cost vanadium.41 These organic \nmolecules offer lower costs, avoid

\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s AI for Good Lab has collaborated with Planet \nLabs PBC to deploy AI models that improve the accuracy \nand speed of assessing vulnerabilities to and damage from \nnatural disasters, including wildfires, floods, and hurricanes. \nThese tools provide detailed insights\u2014not just the number \nof buildings damaged, but also the extent of damage to \neach structure. This information has helped humanitarian \norganizations prioritize aid, guide recovery efforts, and \naccelerate the restoration of affected communities. \nHaving already used these models to inform disaster \nresponse from Libya to Spain and Turkey to Granada, we are \ncontinually improving them and making them accessible to \nhumanitarian and emergency response teams worldwide. \n\nAccelerating

Innovations for a Better Future \n\nAlongside our longstanding advocacy on renewable energy \nissues, we expanded our policy engagement on nuclear, fusion, \nand other advanced carbon-free solutions by joining the US \nNuclear Industry Council, EU SMR Alliance, and Fusion Industry \nAssociation. As outlined in our policy brief Accelerating A Carbon-\nFree Future, we advocate for a diversity of technologies including \nadvanced nuclear energy as critical to achieving net-zero energy \nsystems, including resilient, decarbonized energy grids.122 \n\nGlobally, we have collaborated with organizations to use AI \nto accelerate policy implementation. For example, Microsoft \nhas partnered with the United Nations Framework Convention \non Climate Change (UNFCCC) to develop an AI-enabled \nplatform and global data hub to simplify the validation and \nanalysis of climate data submitted by the 195 parties to the \nParis Agreement, supporting transparency and reporting of \ngreenhouse gas emissions. \n\nAligning policies to incentivize and guide \nthe use of AI for sustainability \nAI is proving to provide tremendous value in a wide range of \nsustainability-related areas, such as the management of energy \nsystems,123 water resources,124 and supply chains,125 as well as in \nESG reporting.62 But many organizations do not yet have the \ncapacity to use these tools effectively.

Actions & Innovations AI Investments Data & Infrastructure Energy & Resources Policy & Governance Workforce capacity Looking ahead \n\nKeeping up with the latest energy data presents another \nchallenge for those working on energy issues. To help address \nthis, the International Energy Agency (IEA) in cooperation with \nMicrosoft developed the WEO-GPT tool hosted on IEA\u2019s website. \nBuilt on Microsoft Azure using Copilot Studio, the WEO-GPT tool \nhas been trained on the full World Energy Outlook 2024 report \nand provides answers based on World Energy Outlook (WEO) \ncontent2,52. It allows users to ask questions about the report \nusing natural, conversational language.52 The tool is designed \nfor anyone curious about the report\u2019s findings to more easily \ndig into its data, analysis, and projections. \n\nClimate risk management \nAI is being used to empower the workforce engaged in climate \nrisk management. Microsoft has partnered with organizations \naround the world to develop AI-powered Copilot assistants that \nare helping people rapidly upskill and more effectively manage \nclimate risks. \n\nFor example, Microsoft and the International Water Management \nInstitute (IWMI) have partnered to develop a Water Copilot for \nthe Limpopo River Basin, which includes parts of Botswana, \nZimbabwe, South Africa, and Mozambique.53 The copilot is \nbased on a comprehensive knowledge base that integrates \nmultilingual regulatory documents, scientific reports, remote-\nsensing workflows, and near real-time sensor data from across the \nwatershed.54 Users can interact with the copilot and retrieve data \nfrom these widespread sources through a chat interface powered \nby GPT-4, empowering

Looking ahead \n\nAccelerating Sustainability with AI: Innovations for a Better Future \n\nWe also partner with local stakeholders to provide educational \nprograms, grants, and initiatives aligned with community needs, \nincluding digital skills training and STEM education. For example, \nMicrosoft has invested over $2.5 million in community programs \nacross more than 70 partners in Iowa.113 The funding has \nsupported financial and computer classes for immigrants and \nrefugees, skilling and career development for underserved \npopulations, and the Microsoft Datacenter Academy, a workforce \ndevelopment program for IT sector employment. In Singapore, \nMicrosoft opened Asia\u2019s first Datacenter Academy in collaboration \nwith the Institute of Technical Education, offering students \nhands-on experience and training for careers in the datacenter \nindustry.114 In Taiwan, as part of the \u201cReimagine Taiwan\u201d initiative, \nMicrosoft is establishing its first datacenter region, aiming \nto upskill over 200,000 workers through a variety of digital \ntraining programs.115 Through these efforts, we aim to empower \ncommunity members with future-ready skills necessary for \nthe digital age. \n\nMicrosoft also contributes to the restoration of local ecosystems \nadjacent to its datacenter sites.

As discussed in Play Four, \ncapacity building is critical, but policies and governance will also \nbe important as these systems rapidly evolve and are deployed. \n\nAt Microsoft, we are engaging broadly to help shape the \nbest practices for using AI for sustainability, including through \nengagements with the UNFCCC on climate, the IEA on energy, \nand the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (UN \nCBD) on biodiversity. For example, at COP16, Microsoft met with \ngovernment and science leaders to demonstrate AI\u2019s potential in \nbiodiversity monitoring and share best practices for its effective \nuse. During these discussions, we highlighted initiatives like \nProject Guacamaya\u2014developed in collaboration with PlanetLabs \nPBC and Colombian research institutions\u2014which developed \nAI enabled solutions to monitor biodiversity. \n\nSustainability policies need to be aligned to incentivize and \nguide the use of AI for sustainability progress, including potential \napplications for AI to support energy efficiency and carbon-\nfree energy deployment. With effective policies in place, AI can \nmaximize its sustainability impacts across industries, optimizing \nsystems, enhancing efficiencies, and improving systems from \nmanufacturing to electric grid management. Enabling AI through \nsupporting policies is critical to addressing complex sustainability \nchallenges from climate and energy to biodiversity and water. \n\nMicrosoft is working with governments and policy stakeholders \nto responsibly use AI for sustainability outcomes.

For this reason, \nthe final play, Play Five, is to build \ncapacity for the workforce to use \nAI for sustainability. \n\nAt Microsoft, we believe that building this workforce capacity \nrequires action on two fronts. First, there is a need to build \nboth AI fluency and sustainability fluency broadly across \nsociety. AI fluency refers to a broad understanding of what \nAI can do, what it cannot do, and how to use AI responsibly. \nSustainability fluency refers to understanding Earth\u2019s life-\nsupporting systems, as well as how humanity is changing them \nand what can be done to protect them. Second, there is a need \nto empower people with more specialized skills and support \nthem in applying AI to specific sustainability challenges, such as \nadvancing carbon-free energy systems, monitoring ecosystems, \nor accelerating circular economy solutions. \n\nBuilding AI fluency \nIn the era of generative AI, building AI capacity is less about \nprogramming and more about building

\nAI -based solution to enhance the \nproductivity of companies and licensing \nexperts undergoing Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission (NRC) licensing and other \nnuclear licensing processes, globally. \nThis solution trains on historic licensing \ndata to streamline the licensing process for \nsmall modular reactors and utility partners. \nIt automatically retrieves real -time or site -\nspecific information, such as flood and \nearthquake history data for a particular \narea, and converts this information into \ndocumentation that can be used in \nlicensing applications. This solution uses \ngenerative AI to apply multiple large \nlanguage models designed for specific \npermitting or licensing tasks. Generative AI \ncan assist with drafting documents using \nexisting datasets, which are then plugged \ninto a licensing workflow for human review \nand improvement, significantly enhancing \nthe productivity of permitting engineers. \n\nCurrently, the permit approval and construction \nprocess alone for the average nuclear power plant \ncan extend up to \n\n12 years \nand cost \n\n$50-100M

\nuse, expand access to \ncarbon-free electricity, \nand support local \ncommunities \nAI operations require resources, such as energy and water. \nTo expand the power and applications of AI\u2019s three game-\nchanging capabilities for sustainability, AI operations must align \nwith global sustainability goals to achieve a net zero and nature \npositive future. To this end, in our playbook released in 2023, we \ndeveloped Play Three to focus on minimizing resource use in the \ndevelopment and operations of AI infrastructure. However, over \nthe last year, it has become clear that minimizing the sustainability \nimpact of AI operations requires more than minimizing resource \nuse in datacenter operations; it also requires supporting the \ndecarbonization of the local energy grids that datacenters and \nthe rest of society\u2019s vital infrastructure rely upon. \n\nExpanding Play 3 \nThe continued development of AI will increase the demand for \nresources, but how much more electric power capacity is needed \nwill depend on how AI models are designed and operated, how \ntechnologies advance, and the pace of AI

This circular solution also uses far less \nwater and energy than extracting virgin materials. \n\nDatacenter design and operations \nMicrosoft is redesigning construction and management of \ndatacenters for greater resource use efficiency and circularity. \nFor example, we have just completed construction of a datacenter \nwith cross-laminated timber, reducing the carbon footprint of \nits construction materials.8 In addition, the Microsoft Climate \nInnovation Fund is supporting development of low-carbon \nconstruction materials, such as low-emissions steel, by investing \nin companies like Stegra (formerly known as H2 Green Steel), \nwhich produces steel with  a reduction of up to 95% of the \nemissions of conventional steel production.99 Microsoft Research \nis working with the datacenter team to harness the power of \nreinforcement learning to add intelligence to traditional HVAC \ncontrols, creating systems that enable real-time adjustments \nwhich can reduce energy and water use.100 \n\nINNOVATION SPOTLIGHT \n\nLow-carbon materials \n\nDecarbonizing the \nbuilt environment \nAt Microsoft, we are innovating the materials used for \ndatacenter exteriors by constructing our first datacenters \nwith lightweight wood to reduce reliance on steel and \nconcrete. Microsoft engineers have developed a hybrid \ndatacenter design that incorporates cross laminated timber, \na fire resistant prefabricated wood material.

Play Four focuses on \nadvancing AI policy principles \nand governance to help accelerate \ndecarbonization of the energy \nsystem, as well as incentivizing \nand guiding the proper use of \nAI for sustainability solutions. \n\nPolicies and governance play a critical role in enabling AI to \naccelerate sustainability progress. Government policies are \nessential for facilitating the decarbonization of electricity grids \nand incentivizing the responsible use of AI in sustainability \nsolutions. At the same time, ensuring that AI models are safe, \nsecure, and trustworthy is vital for their deployment in managing \nthe essential systems that underpin sustainability progress. \n\nThe following examples highlight how Microsoft is helping to \nadvance the development of policies and governance frameworks \nthat facilitate the development and widespread deployment of \nAI\u2019s three game-changing capabilities. \n\nAdvocating for policies that accelerate \ndecarbonization of electricity grids \nAt Microsoft, we are working to accelerate carbon-free electricity, \nexpand grid infrastructure, and scale markets through policy \nadvocacy in the United States, Europe, and Asia. Over the past \nyear, in the United States, we supported new Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission (FERC) transmission rules to improve and \nexpedite regional grid planning, as well as proposals to

fill gaps and \nincrease accessibility of data that can help strengthen AI models \nto support three sectors: climate risk management, biodiversity, \nand carbon removal. \n\nClimate risk management \nBetween 2010 and 2020, almost 18 million people in Asia were \ndisplaced by natural hazards, compared with around 1 million \npeople in North America.69 As the world experiences increasingly \nsevere impacts of climate change, we need better tools to support \ncommunities before, during, and after extreme weather events. \nAI-enabled models can help people better understand and \npredict complex climate risks (AI\u2019s first game-changing capability) \nand inform risk prevention,70 empowering disaster response \nteams71 and resource mobilization72 (AI\u2019s third game-changing \ncapability). But poor data in many regions limit the effectiveness \nof these models to provide robust insights and predictions to \nsupport decision making. \n\nAccelerating Sustainability with AI: Innovations for a Better Future 16 \n\n\n\nForeword Actions & Innovations AI Investments Data & Infrastructure Energy & Resources Policy & Governance Workforce capacity Looking ahead \n\nFor example, household census data and associated demographic \nmetadata are often outdated and incomplete, failing to capture \nhigh-density clustering of populations in temporary and \ndynamic housing, particularly in the developing world.73 To help \nfill these data gaps, Microsoft is working with the University of \nWashington\u2019s Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) to \nuse high-resolution satellite imagery from Planet Labs PBC, spatial \ndemographic analysis, and AI to estimate the extent of the built \nenvironment and how population is changing over time.74 \n\nData access can also constrain the full potential of AI\u2019s game-\nchanging capabilities. For example, satellites collect increasing \namounts of data each year, creating a growing data repository \nof tremendous value for managing climate risks, accelerating

To tackle these challenges, NASA IMPACT \ncollaborated with Microsoft to develop Earth Copilot, which \nallows users to interact with NASA\u2019s data repository through \nplain language queries, facilitating a broader range of users in \ninteracting with its Earth science data.75 \n\nBiodiversity protection \nData limitations constrain the ability to use AI\u2019s full potential \nto measure, protect, and report on biodiversity. It is estimated \nthat less than 7% of the world\u2019s ecosystems have been surveyed \nfor biodiversity at a spatial resolution of 5 square kilometers or \nless,76 with nearly 80% of the available data coming from just 10 \ncountries in the Northern Hemisphere (Figure 1).77 \n\nThese large data gaps persist in large part because traditional \nfield-based biodiversity observations are expensive and \ntime-consuming and are thus difficult to scale. However, new \nAI-enabled technologies like Microsoft\u2019s SPARROW can help \novercome this challenge.6,79 SPARROW\u2014an autonomous \nSolar-Powered Acoustic and Remote Recording Observation \nWatch\u2014integrates AI-enabled camera, bioacoustics, and other \nenvironmental sensors on a single platform that can be deployed \nto the remotest reaches of the planet and transmit resulting \ndata directly to satellites overhead.6 Thus, AI-enabled sensors \nused by Project Guacamaya32 and SPARROW6 not only fill gaps \nin observational biodiversity data but also incorporate new \ntypes of

to accelerate sustainability is also \nhindered by limited access to digital infrastructure. As of 2023, one \nthird of the world still lacked internet access.83 While connectivity \ntrends are improving, progress remains uneven.84 More than half \nof the globe lacks internet connectivity at the broadband speeds \nthat enable productive use of cloud services and AI.83 \n\nGlobally, 2.7 billion people remain disconnected from the internet \nand therefore cannot use AI to accelerate

By utilizing AI-powered \npredictive analytics, Eavor can anticipate \ndrilling challenges and make proactive \nadjustments, downtime and increasing \ndrilling efficiency. \n\nMicrosoft has also reduced water consumption with \ninnovative cooling technologies in new datacenter designs. \nThrough advancements in datacenter operations and chip design, \nwe have cut water intensity (water consumed per kilowatt-hour) \nby over 80% since the early 2000s.101 Direct-to-chip cooling, such \nas cold plates, dissipates heat more efficiently than traditional \nair cooling by directly chilling the silicon and recirculating the \ncooling fluid in a closed-loop system. This method enhances \ncooling efficiency and allows for precise temperature control. \nTo take advantage of these benefits, Microsoft is developing new \ndatacenter designs optimized for direct-to-chip cooling, which \ninvolves reconfiguring server and rack layouts to accommodate \nadvanced thermal and power management techniques. \n\nIn existing facilities, innovations like the \u201csidekick\u201d liquid cooling \nsystem are employed alongside racks of Microsoft Azure Maia \nAI Accelerator chips, circulating fluid to draw heat away from the \ncold plates attached to the chips\u2019 surfaces. Additionally, Microsoft \nis exploring microfluidics, a technology that integrates tiny fluid \nchannels into chip designs, bringing coolant directly next to \nprocessors for increased efficiency and precision. \n\nOur newest datacenter designs are optimized to support AI \nworkloads and consume zero water for cooling.

We are \ncommitted to being responsible neighbors, contributing to local \neconomies and ecosystems, and ensuring that our datacenters \naddress community needs and priorities.109 For example, in West \nDes Moines, Iowa, where Microsoft operates datacenters, we \nhave invested directly in supporting the community through \npartnerships with educational institutions and support for \ninfrastructure projects like the construction of a water tower, \nnew schools, and new bridges.110 \n\nWe collaborate to identify opportunities to create efficiency \nand bring value to local communities. For example, in Finland, \nwe joined forces with the public utility Fortum to build a \ndatacenter area that produces emission-free heat for Fortum\u2019s \ncustomers in the Helsinki metropolitan area.111 Additionally, in \nQuincy, Washington, we partnered with the city to open the \nstate\u2019s first industrial water reuse center. In Ireland, we integrated \nbatteries into wind turbines for a wind energy project, allowing \nus to capture excess energy when the turbines over-perform \nand deliver it to the local grid. Similarly, in Denmark, excess heat \ngenerated from a Microsoft datacenter will be used to heat the \nlocal community, providing enough warmth for around 6,000 \nhomes.112 These are examples of how we are using our datacenters \nas a source of energy to relieve pressure on local electric grids. \n\n25 \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n   \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n  \n\n \n \n \n \n\n
